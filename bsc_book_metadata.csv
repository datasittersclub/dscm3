I wanted to write a book about learning disabilities because my sister has dyslexia. However, this is not the first book I’ve written about the subject. I’ve also written a non-Baby-sitters Club book called Yours Turly, Shirley, about a nine-year old girl named Shirley Basini and her difficult year in fourth grade. The idea for the title, Yours Turly, Shirley, came from one of my students the year I taught fourth and fifth graders in Connecticut. The boy, who had dyslexia, made me an elaborate Christmas card. With a ballpoint pen, on a folded sheet of notebook paper, he drew Santa Claus standing next to a Christmas tree surrounded by gifts. Inside the card he wrote, “Dear Miss Martin, a very very very very very merry Christmas, and a happy New Year!!!!!!! Yours turly, Jimmy.” I treasured the card and saved it for years, and when it came time to title the book about Shirley, I thought of Jimmy. I thought of him again, and of other kids I’ve known, when I wrote about Shea. I decided Claudia would be especially understanding of Shea because she has problems in school herself."

They looked so much alike that they were able to fool people. I knew several sets of twins, including my cousins Lyman and Jimmy, but none of them were identical. They couldn’t get away with what Patty and Cathy could on the show. So I created twins who could — Marilyn and Carolyn Arnold. In fact, I like identical twins so much that I put a set in the Baby-sitters Little Sister series, and the newest member of the Baby-sitters Club is a twin, too.

She lived in New York all her life until, in the summer before 7th grade she and her parents moved to Stoneybrook, Connecticut. Then, just after 8th grade had started, in book # 13 she moved back to New York. Her parents promptly began fighting and they got divorced in book 28. Stacey's Mother moved back to Stoneybrook and her Father stayed in New York. When the book starts Stacey is starting to go off the diet that she has to stay on because of her diabetes. Stacey also has an upcoming weekend trip to visit her Father in New York. On the first night of the trip Stacey's father becomes worried when he hears her getting up in the middle of the night for water many times. Once, he actually confronts her and asks her to check her blood sugar. She refuses evasively and goes back to bed. In the morning they just up and leave for the hospital. Her mother comes and stays with the Cummings, leading to a whole fight about how her parents can't be in the same room as each other. At first she starts to feel better, but then she wakes up one day as bad as when she just came into the hospital. The BSC (minus Junior Members) chose that day of all days to come and visit! They also start an IV pumping insulin straight into her veins. It does bring her blood sugar down but something is wrong. Then they start mixing different types of insulin and Stacey gets better."

If you do find yourself stuck in the middle, as Mary Anne was when Jessi and Mal were fighting, try to remain as impartial as possible and try not to take sides. If you do take sides, you’re bound to alienate one friend, and two against one never looks fair. When Mary Anne got stuck in the middle, she did take sides at first. Then she found a better approach. She listened to both of her fighting friends, and encouraged them to talk to each other. Remember — the fight is really your friends’ problem, not yours, and ultimately it’s up to them to work things out."

As a child I was very healthy, and I rarely missed school. However, early in June at the end of sixth grade, I had an accident. I fell out of a tree fort in my back yard and landed on a stump, rupturing my spleen. (For those of you who read the Baby-sitters Little Sister books, you will recognize this story in #81, Karen’s Accident.) When this happened, I was playing in our woods with my best friend, Beth, and our neighbor Jessi. Jessi was trying out our new archery set, and when I fell out of the tree, she thought she had shot me! She hadn’t, of course. But that night I had surgery to remove my spleen, and I stayed in the hospital for a week. Being in the hospital wasn’t all bad, though. For one thing, the hospital was just down the street from my school. One day at lunchtime, my teacher brought several of my classmates to visit. They weren’t allowed in the hospital, but they stood outside and we visited through the window. After a week I was allowed to leave the hospital, and then I stayed in bed for another week. I missed the rest of school that year."

Her favorite thing in the box is her mother's old dolls, which she would like to create clothes for. Mary Anne notes that her father does not speak much about her mother other than to bless her during grace every night before dinner. In order to gain her father's favor, she makes dinner and asks to start baby-sitting with Kristy. She and her father have a small argument, but she ends- up winning and is allowed to go sit with Kristy, provided she is home by nine and calls her father every half hour.

Derek is due to perform a stunt of his own where he falls through a pane of glass. The propmaster ordered special break-away glass for the shoot which won’t hurt Derek when he falls. After Derek’s little brother, Todd accidentally kicks a rock through the glass and breaks it, everyone discovers that the glass was real & Derek could’ve been badly injured if he had gone ahead with the stunt. The propmaster assures that he ordered breakaway glass from Rockaway and Sons (a local glass company) and doesn’t know how the real glass got there, but he gets fired anyway."

When we decided to fill Dawn’s spot in the club with a new character, we also decided to let our readers name the character. Over the years we’ve received many letters from kids suggesting new characters, or names for new characters. So my editors agreed to run a contest to name the new character. Because it takes a year or more to make a book, and because we were already writing about the new character, we had to call her something until the contest was over. So guess what — we called her Lucy Ricardo (after my favorite TV character) and we named her twin Ethel (after Lucy Ricardo’s best friend). I wrote ten manuscripts using the names Lucy and Ethel Ricardo before the contest was over. We had to go back through all those manuscripts before they could be published and change every Lucy and Ethel to Abby and Anna! It was a lot of work, but running the contest was a lot of fun, too. Welcome to the series, Abby and Anna!"

The Basher players keep distracting Bart so they can make fun of and insult many of the Krusher players. Bart challenges Kristy to a game, which she accepts. Nicky Pike was asked to pitch during the game but came down with a fever the morning of the game, leaving David Michael and Jake Kuhn to pitch for the Krushers. During the game, Jackie Rodowsky knocks over the refreshment table and the Pike triplets show up in their Little League uniforms to cheer on the Krushers. Although the Bashers won the seven inning game 16-11, Kristy realizes how much her teams loves to play and how much team spirit they have, even if they know they aren't the best players."

When I graduated from college, I was thrilled because I thought I would never have to work another math problem again. I was wrong. I find that I use math almost every day, especially when I’m sewing, one of my favorite pastimes. Sewing involves a lot of measuring, figuring, and refiguring. I keep a calculator on my sewing table, and it helps, but there are some things you can only figure out with your brain.

Starting when I was young, our families got together every single year at Christmastime to exchange gifts and celebrate the holiday. On most years we got together on Christmas Eve. We usually had dinner at a restaurant called Good Time Charley’s, and then gathered at either their house or ours to exchange presents. Now many years have passed, and we’ve all gone through lots of changes. The Rice kids are married now, and Robert even has kids of his own. Everyone has scattered. We live all up and down the East Coast. But if we can, we still try to get together. It’s an important tradition. Families, friends, togetherness — that’s what holidays are all about."

In my family, privacy was important to my sister and me, and we were lucky because we had our own rooms. It’s too bad we didn’t have two back seats in our station wagon, because that would have solved a problem on long car trips. Each of us wanted our own space in the car. In order to create it, we would divide the back seat in half, and we weren’t allowed to cross the line. If we did, a fight usually ensued. Neither Jane nor I ever went on strike, but our parents frequently threatened to pull the car over until we could settle down."

Mr. Mackey knew how to make art creative, fun, and interesting. (When he arrived at our class, he always raised his arms and swung himself through the doorway!) My next favorite teacher was Miss Kushel, who taught me in third grade. She helped give me a love of reading, and I adored her because she thought I could do anything. In seventh and eighth grade my wonderful creative writing teacher was Mr. Dougherty (whom Mallory’s creative writing teacher is named for). He sparked our imaginations and told us we could all be great writers. There have been many other great teachers since, but Mr. Mackey, Miss Kushel, and Mr. Dougherty stand out. They gave me wonderful gifts and showed me what a great teacher can do."

By the time I was ten, I had a huge shelf full of books I loved. That was why I decided to start a lending library in my bedroom. I spent a long time one summer making pockets to put in the back of each book, and cards to go in the pockets. I opened my library to the kids in the neighborhood, and let them check out books to read. That was the summer I wanted to be a librarian. I changed my mind about a career lots of times after that, but as you can see, I still ended up working with children’s books. And I still have all the books that were on the shelves of my long-ago library."

Mrs. Newton calls needing a sitter for Jamie and Lucy. Kristy takes the job without bothering to check who is available. Claudia then calls her a job hog. Stacey then points out to Claudia that she does it lots of times, and before you know it, all three are at each others' throats. Stacey reminds everyone that she's from New York and doesn't need shy little babies (Mary Anne), stuck-up job hogs (Claudia), and bossy know-it-alls (Kristy) as friends. This causes Mary Anne to cry. Kristy then tells her to shut up and calls her a crybaby. Mary Anne then snaps and calls everyone mean names and runs home and cries. She then angrily prepares dinner for herself and her father. Her father then comes home and they ask God to watch over Alma (Mary Anne's deceased mother). Then she escapes to her room and decides not to tell her father about the fight. She thinks about calling Claudia, since Claudia didn't say anything mean directly to her. She is, however, not allowed on the phone after dinner. When she is ready for bed, she tries to apologize to Kristy using the flashlight code that they use. Kristy simply pulls her shade down. Then Mary Anne realized how angry Kristy was."

However, even though I knew that I did not like public speaking, I felt that because I was expected to be a speaker, I should be one. For years I spoke at schools and at conferences. I thought that I would get better at it, or at least that I would learn to enjoy it. But neither one happened. Finally I realized that I truly am not a good speaker, so I stopped doing any kind of public speaking. It wasn’t worth the anxiety it caused. Since then, I’ve become very careful about people’s expectations. And I did learn something about speaking — to speak up when I’m not comfortable with something. That’s a lesson everyone should learn!"

The way the code was supposed to work was that if I sensed trouble I would call Beth, give her a code word, and then she would call the police for me. Of course, we never had a phantom phone caller like Claudia did, and we never had to use our code, but we had a lot of fun scaring ourselves.

I baby-sat all summer and saved my money, and at the end of the summer, I brought a new Sears Kenmore, which I still have and still use. For a long time, I sewed a lot of my own clothes. But when I got older, and my friends and cousins started having babies, I turned to sewing for children. This led to learning different sewing and needlework techniques, such as smocking, ribbon embroidery, and heirloom sewing. In fact, sewing has become so important to me that recently I declared Mondays to be sewing days instead of writing days."

We never had one quite as elaborate as the one Dawn has in Dawn and the Big Sleepover. But they were always lots of fun. Most of our sleepovers were held at my best friend Beth’s house because she had a big rec room. Some of our favorite activities were playing Twister, Categories, and Battleship; making taffy (this was rarely successful); and, of course, eating junk food. But our favorite activity was watching Alfred Hitchcock’s movie The Birds. Remember that I grew up in the days before VCRs, so we couldn’t just bring a movie to a sleepover. We had to wait until The Birds was going to be on television, and then plan our sleepover around it. Another event we often tried to plan a sleepover around was New Year’s Eve. We would try to stay up all night, but we rarely made it past three or four in the morning. I haven’t been to a sleepover in years, but every time I hear of one I remember the fun parties my friends and I used to have."

I was very embarrassed when my teachers suggested to my parents that they find a math tutor for me. But after I started working with my tutor and doing better, math wasn’t so bad anymore. My tutor was Johnny Valentine. He lived across the street from me. He was six years older, and I thought he knew everything. Guess what — Johnny used to be one of my baby-sitters."

When I was growing up, I was the big sister like Janine, and Jane was my little sister, like Claudia. We were just two years apart, but for a long time we weren’t very close. We had different friends and very different interests. I excelled in school, and my sister excelled in sports and was involved in lots of activities. It was not until we had grown up and each moved to New York City that we became friends and spent a lot of time together. Now my sister is not just my sister, but a mother too, and I have a brand-new nephew Henry, named after our father. Relationships constantly change — so who knows ... maybe one day Claudia and Janine will be best friends too!"

Mallory gets a baby-sitting job for the Delaneys (a.k.a ""the Snobs""), the triplets have a yard service, Nicky gets a paper route, Vanessa - get this- styles hair and Margo and Claire sell lemonade. Mallory and her brothers and sisters are making money, but losing friends. Kids start teasing them and spreading rumors about why Mr. Pike lost his job. They learn who their true friends are. Meanwhile the Delaney kids are having the same problem - in reverse. They have just got a new pool and kids from all over the neighborhood want to come and play. Mallory helps them out though. They tell their friends that there is a new rule that when a baby-sitter is in charge no one can use the pool. Then they invite their friends over."

She's been pulled in opposite directions for a long time and has important ties to each coast. She's even moved back to California briefly, and then returned to Stoneybrook. Finally my editors and I decided that Dawn needed to make a choice and stick to it. And we felt that Dawn would choose California. This was a difficult decision, but once it had been made, we realized that it created an opportunity for new things to happen in the Baby-sitters Club. We decided to replace Dawn with a brand-new member of the BSC, who would be as important to the series as any of the other characters. That's how Abby was created. Furthermore, we decided to give Dawn her very own series, set on the West Coast. That's how California Diaries began. All in all, we felt that the decision to take Dawn out of Stoneybrook turned out to be a happy one, with many exciting things in store for the characters and the series."

Then I created Kristy, Claudia, Stacey, and Mary Anne. I wanted to create a group of kids who are very different from one another but work well together. I based Kristy on my best friend from when I was growing up, and Mary Anne on me. Kristy was the outgoing one with all the big ideas, and Mary Anne was the quiet one.

Now I get about 17,000 letters a year, so of course I can't be pen pals with all the kids who write to me. However, I make sure that everyone who writes gets a letter back.

I hear from lots of kids who are new in their school or town, and want to find ways to make friends. As Claudia found out, there are lots of ways to do this. One of the best is to think about things you like to do. For instance, do you like sports? Join a team at your school or in your town. Do you like art? Maybe your school is putting on a play, and you could work on the scenery or costumes. Do you feel like trying your hand at something new? See if you can take a class.

We took walks on the beach, we ate dinner at the Casino, and we shopped at the one small store in town. Since I lived in New York City at the time, I loved the fact that there are no cars allowed in Davis Park. There are no streets. People walk everywhere, the houses are connected by boardwalks, and we would pull luggage or groceries around in little red wagons."

And I wanted a character who was different from the other girls in the Baby-sitters Club. Many readers had asked for a character who is a twin. Many others had asked for a character who is Jewish. So we took these and other things into consideration, and created Abby and Anna Stevenson, whom you have just read about in Abby’s very first book, Welcome to the BSC, Abby.

Others were already dieting and wanted to know if they were going about it properly. Still others were concerned about friends who seemed to be taking their diets to an extreme. They wanted to know how they could help their friends. Dieting can be a complicated issue for anybody. It’s true that many Americans are overweight, which is not healthy. Being overweight can lead to heart disease and other serious problems. On the other hand, it is equally unhealthy to be underweight. A severe eating disorder is anorexia, which is what Jessi’s friend Mary Bramstedt develops."

Since I’ve lived in New York for a long time, it was lots of fun creating Stacey’s life there — her neighborhood, her friends, her apartment. I love living in New York. It’s so exciting, and there’s so much to do. Like Stacey, I enjoy going to the theater and museums, and I love trying different kinds of food. When I was a kid, I liked reading books that were set in New York City. Some of my favorites were Stuart Little, The Cricket in Times Square, and Eloise. (By the way, Eloise was one of Stacey’s favorite books when she was little.) So if you’ve just finished Stacey’s Mistake and you’re ready for another New York adventure, how about trying one of these? From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, or Slake’s Limbo."

In elementary school, a week or so before Valentine’s Day, we would make folders out of red construction paper and tape them to the fronts of our desks. During the next few days whenever kids brought their valentines into class they would walk around the room and distribute them in the folders. We were not supposed to open them until our class party on Valentine’s Day. The year I was in fifth grade, I decided to make all of my valentines instead of buying them in the store. I had a lot of fun, but I was a little embarrassed by them and wondered if they were as good as store-bought ones. So I decided not to sign them. I thought I could give them to my classmates anonymously. What I hadn’t counted on was that I would be the only student not to sign her cards. So by process of elimination, everyone had figured out exactly who made the cards. But I still love sending Valentine’s Day cards. In fact, I send cards for every possible occasion. But now I’ve learned to sign them."

The first time I took lessons I was about five years old, and I carpooled with three other girls in my neighborhood. One of them was named Lovey, which was a nickname for Adelaide. My dad used to pick us up from ballet, just like Mr. Ramsey picks Jessi up. Dad would arrive in our little blue Renault. The car was old, and every time Dad put on the brakes, the car squeaked. Lovey said that the noise was made by mice who lived in the dashboard. Obviously, since my main memory of ballet lessons is the car ride home, ballet was not as important to me as it is to Jessi. However, although I was not cut out to be a dancer myself, I love all kinds of dance. My favorite is tap! So those lessons were important to me after all."

While they’re good about sharing the jobs they get at club meetings, they’re now fiercely competing for a limited number of jobs that they all want badly. Competition can be difficult, especially when friends are competing against one another. You may find yourself competing against a friend in sports, in school, in contests, or, like the members of the BSC, for a job. An important thing to remember when you’re competing against a friend is that both your friendship and the competition are important, so it’s your responsibility to do your best, honestly. You’re not being fair to your friend if you don’t do your best in order to let her win. And you’re not being fair to anyone if, like Kristy, you don’t play by the rules. Try keeping things out in the open. If you and a friend are competing against each other, talk about it. Tell each other what you’re afraid of, and what you hope for. Then go for it. Mary Anne and her friends might have had an easier time if they had been honest with themselves and with one another from the beginning."

One of the biggest decisions I ever had to make was where to go to college. To begin with, my guidance counselor had looked at my SAT scores and told me they were low, so there were very few colleges I would be able to get into. My parents looked at my grades and my activities, and decided that was ridiculous. Together, we visited thirteen colleges, and I applied to five. I was accepted at all of them, including two of the top women’s colleges in the country, Smith and Mount Holyoke. I knew I wanted to go to one of these colleges, and I liked both of them very much, but I liked Smith a little better. However, my mother had gone to Mount Holyoke. I agonized over this decision for days. I knew my mother would be happy if I went to Mount Holyoke, and I didn’t want to disappoint her. However, my heart was telling me to go to Smith. In the end, that was the decision I made — and it was the best decision of my life!"

For the first time, we were switching classes all day long and had locker combinations to remember, and the eighth-graders seemed so much older than us! Furthermore, near the beginning of the school year, the entire seventh grade had to go to a camp about an hour away, for three days and three nights. I was terrified. I had never been to camp, and I didn’t want to go away with so many people I didn’t know. Of course, everything turned out fine, and once we got there we had a good time. My old friends were on the trip, and I made some new ones as well. When it was over and we came home, I couldn’t believe I had worried about it so much. Seventh grade turned out to be fine, too.

They try very hard but they lack the skills or the age to play Little League ball. Upon seeing how much Karen, David Michael, and Andrew (and other BSC charges) really want to play, she decides to form a team. Jackie Rodowsky, a lovable charge with a penchant for disaster (dropping lemonade, knocking over a refreshment table, breaking a window at the elementary school, etc.) comes up with the name of Kristy's Krushers. Karen insists that the team name is spelled wrong and so irons the spelling of ""Crushers"" onto her team shirt. The team gets permission to practice twice a week at the Stoneybrook Elementary School playground. Watson becomes a valuable source to Kristy in terms of advice and help in coaching her team."

I remember how much fun it was to get mail when I was young. Now, as you might imagine, I get lots of mail — about 17,000 letters a year from kids who read the books I write. After my first book came out, I received just a few letters every year. I was able to answer those letters personally. But now I get almost fifty letters a day, so several people help me answer them. It’s fun! If kids ask questions about baby-sitting, we send them a sheet of baby-sitting tips. If they ask about writing, we send them a sheet of writing tips. Lots of times I get letters from kids who are writing as a school project. Right now a popular project is making an author quilt. The students send blank squares of fabric to authors and ask the authors to sign the squares and return them. Then the squares are sewn together to make a quilt for their classroom or school. One of the funniest requests I get is from kids who are making a garbage wall! They ask authors to send them an item of trash from their wastebasket.

If you are going to baby-sit for an infant, it is important to be prepared. Baby-sitting for an infant is very different from sitting for an older child. You might think it will be easy because you don’t have to entertain an infant. Wrong! If you’re going to sit for an infant, there’s a lot you need to know. Babies can’t tell you what they need, so you have to be prepared. In fact, don’t be surprised if parents with a new baby don’t call you right away with a sitting job. There’s a good chance they may ask a sitter who’s older, or even an adult. A good way to show clients that you are capable of taking care of a new baby is to take an infant care course. Check with the Red Cross or the Y in your community to see if they offer such a course. When I was thirteen, I took a course at my church. Another way to learn how to take care of a baby is to start out as a parent’s helper — helping out while the mom or dad is at home. Believe me, they’ll welcome the help!"

Then, when I was in college, I became a student teacher myself. At Smith College, I did my student teaching at the Campus School. This is a private elementary school located on the college campus. The first semester, I taught in the three-year-old class at the preschool. The second semester, I taught in the kindergarten. I thought that after I graduated, I would teach preschoolers. As it turned out, my one and only teaching job was in a fourth/fifth grade class. It wasn’t what I had planned on, but I thoroughly enjoyed that year of teaching, partly because I got to use children’s literature in the classroom. During the year, I read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, A Bear Called Paddington, and A Wrinkle in Time, among others, to my students. The kids enjoyed this activity, and I really enjoyed it, so much so that at the end of the school year, I decided to enter the children’s publishing field instead of returning to teaching. And I’ve been involved in books and kids ever since!"

So did my best friend, Beth, and her family. But two summers my family went to Surf City. The fictional town of Sea City is based partly on Surf City and partly on Wildwood, the town next to Avalon. And some of the incidents that take place in Sea City are based on experiences that Beth and I had when we were in Avalon. For example, we thought it was fun to attract the attention of the lifeguards — who were much older than we were! There was a little tiny boardwalk with some shops and an arcade where Beth and my sister, Jane, and I played Skee-Ball. Every time we scored points at Skee-Ball, we won coupons that could be turned in for prizes, like keychains and small stuffed animals. The summers at the beach were a long time ago, but now I can think about them every time I write a Baby-sitters Club book about Sea City."

Some baby-sitting episodes are about things that happened to me when I was a sitter. My own baby-sitting memories gave me the idea for BSC #2, Claudia and the Phantom Phone Calls. For me, the best story ideas come from real life. This is why when kids ask for writing tips, I always recommend that they keep a journal — not so much for writing practice, but as a source of ideas."

Martin, Peter Lerangis","Hodges Soileau","Will the boy baby-sitters ruin everything?","June 1996","Lots of kids write to me asking if they are old enough to start baby-sitting. That’s a difficult question, because the answer depends on so many things. It depends on how much experience you’ve had with other kids, and how prepared you are to baby-sit. And it depends on the age of the kids you’ll be sitting for. For example, if you’re ten, like the Pike triplets and Jeff Schafer, you are probably not going to get a job sitting for a nine-year-old! Also, you need to be prepared to baby-sit for kids of any age. Before you start sitting, I suggest taking a first aid class, an infant care class, or a sitting class such as the one offered by the Red Cross. If you are younger and you think you’re ready to sit, a good way to start is by going along on a job with a more experienced sitter or taking a job as a parent’s helper, where you watch the kids while a parent is at home. One of the best places to get experience is in your home, taking care of your younger brothers and sisters, just like Jessi and Mallory did. Whatever you do, remember that sitting is a big job and a lot of responsibility. The Pikes and Jeff tried it, and decided they weren’t ready for it yet. They’ll probably try again in a couple of years."

It’s never easy learning that a member of your family faces a serious medical problem, but as Abby found, one of the best things you can do is learn as much as possible about the illness. It also helps to be able to talk to your family to share information and feelings. One nice thing that often happens when a family member is sick is that the rest of the family pulls together to help out. When my father had open-heart surgery, my family and also our friends rallied around with support, food, advice, phone calls, and visits, all of which made my father’s recovery smoother and quicker. You don’t need to throw a big party to show your love for someone — the little things count just as much."

When Kristy’s mother marries Watson, Kristy acquires a stepfather, and Karen and Andrew become important characters in the books. In fact, Kristy’s little stepsister Karen was becoming such an important character, and I enjoyed writing about her so much, that it was around this time that I began to consider giving her a series of her own.

Before the concert, the girls were using Stacey's employee discount at a store in the mall to buy things than returning them for full price. At the concert, the girls bring in wine but get caught. They pretty much blame it on Stacey but luckily she had diabetes (yes, luckily) and she wasn't getting sick, so she couldn't have drunk the wine (which has sugar in it).

I went to hear a local group called Bop Shoo Bop that played 1950s doo-wop music. This was the early 1970s, when the TV show Happy Days was popular. My friend Beth was old enough to drive, so she drove us and a group of friends. Our parents knew what we were doing, of course, and nothing like what happened to Stacey happened to us at the concert. We just wanted to enjoy the music and have a good time. And that's what we did. I've been to a number of concerts since then, but that one will always be memorable."

Incredibly, the month that this book was published marks the tenth anniversary of the publication of the first Baby-sitters Club book, Kristy’s Great Idea, back in August 1986. So much has happened since then. The Baby-sitters Club has launched three other series, Baby-sitters Little Sister, the Baby-sitters Club Mysteries, and, most recently, The Kids in Ms. Colman’s Class. The books have been translated into nineteen languages, including Chinese and Hebrew. There have been games, dolls, jewelry, clothing, a CD, and audiotapes. A true fan can also join the BSC fan club, watch the TV series, or rent the Baby-sitters Club movie. These have been ten great years and a hundred fun books. Maybe in the year 2005 we'll be celebrating the publication of book #200!"

Cokie can do things that the members of the Baby-sitters Club would never do. In the Baby-sitters Club movie, she was given a particularly big role. It was a lot of fun to cast her — to find an actress to play Cokie’s part. I very much enjoyed seeing Cokie come to life on the screen. In case you’re wondering, I named Cokie after somebody I went to high school with. However, unlike Cokie Mason, the real Cokie was a very nice person.

Jessi finds she loves living in Brooklyn and that being a kid in New York is not as different from being a kid in Stoneybrook as she had thought it would be. She can visit her friends at their apartments. They can order pizza and have a party. She also finds that, unlike in Stoneybrook, she can order in any kind of food at any hour of the day. Plus, she can go to a movie — or she can go to a Broadway show, a jazz club, a museum, or an art gallery. Instead of being driven in a car when she wants to go somewhere, she can take the subway."

Some of these businesses are modeled after the Baby-sitters Club, others are run differently. Some last for many years, some are short-lived. Every now and then the members of a baby-sitting club come to a store where I’m signing books, and I meet other real-life Dawns and Kristys and Jessis. Running a business can be difficult, though, and it takes a lot of hard work. For that reason, many kids have started other kinds of clubs. They meet regularly to have fun, and talk about books."

When I was in third grade, I began taking piano lessons, which I also loved, and continued for years. In middle school, I took exactly two tennis lessons and quit — tennis was not for me. In high school, my interests changed. I began doing a lot of volunteer work and tutoring — interests that continued throughout college. Now, as an adult, instead of doing volunteer work, I have my own foundation. I also like to cross-country ski. But guess what my favorite activities are — sewing, needlework, and crafts.

Since most of my relatives are from Louisville, Kentucky, I decided that was the city Logan would move from. It was while I was writing this book that I realized a year had passed in the lives of the BSC characters. Mary Anne was the last of the original club members to turn thirteen, and the series was still going strong. So my editors and I decided that the characters would have to remain this age.

So eventually she decides that the Baby-sitters Club is not for her. I think this was the right decision for Wendy — and for the Baby-sitters Club. The last thing any organization needs is a member who isn’t fully committed to it. One of the biggest problems I’ve faced as an adult is planning my time to keep up with all of my commitments. There are a lot of them, and I take them very seriously. Not only is there my writing, but I’ve started two foundations, and recently, I committed to a fifty-state tour to promote the Baby-sitters Club. In order to devote enough time to each of these things, I have to plan my schedule very carefully. Plus, I do like to have some free time. Now when I’m asked to join another organization, or to do anything that involves a big time commitment, I think very carefully before I say yes. Saying no isn’t easy, but I’d rather do that, than say yes and then not be able to do what I agreed to do. So the next time you’re thinking of starting something new, consider how you really want to spend your time. And make sure that if you say yes, you really mean it."

All of this netted me seven dollars, but I was thrilled. I went to Woolworth’s and bought them a set of orange juice glasses.

I was interested in lots of things, and I was always starting new projects. I tried stamp collecting, coin collecting, macramé, and needlework. Although I was not a very active kid, I did try ballet lessons, and I took exactly three tennis lessons! I attacked each new project or hobby (except for the tennis lessons) with a vengeance, even if it didn’t last long. For instance, my stamp collection began when I inherited a partially filled stamp album. I soon discovered that I could get stamps from all over the world through the mail, and I spent hours ordering and arranging stamps. For a long time one of my biggest hobbies was magic. It started when my father, an amateur magician, gave me all of his old tricks. Then, just like with the stamp collecting, I found that I could order magic tricks through the mail. I pored through catalogues, ordering new tricks, and then I entertained my charges with them. So the next time you’re bored, just think of all the things you could try. And you can find out about most hobbies simply by going to the library. You’ll be amazed by what you can find there."

Everything from small local ones to the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus in New York City. Because I like the circus so much, I decided to put one on one day for the kids in my neighborhood. My friend Beth and my sister were going to be in the circus, too. Beth and I were about seven at the time, and Jane was about five. It was a hot summer day and we decided to hold the circus in our garage. We spent all morning making tickets to the show and selling them door to door. But in the afternoon when the audience showed up, we realized that we had forgotten to plan the circus. We were very embarrassed and quickly threw together a little show which was not at all rehearsed. Despite this, my enthusiasm for the circus was not dampened. And even today I still enjoy a trip to the big top!"

As you may know, when I started writing the Baby-sitters Club I wanted to create a group of characters who are very different from each other, but who work well together. Each of the members of the BSC faces her own set of difficulties. I thought it would be interesting if one character faced physical or medical problems. I chose diabetes because it affects many kids, and because I have two friends with diabetes. I also wanted to create a character who copes with her disability in a positive way. Stacey doesn’t ignore her illness — she deals with it responsibly, but she tries not to let it interfere with her life."

Not long after that, I saw Mary Poppins four times — so you can tell how much I liked that movie! As I grew older, I began to watch scarier movies. By the time I was about thirteen, one of my favorite movies was Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds. My friend Beth liked it too. We tried to time our sleepovers, which were usually held at Beth’s house, for nights when The Birds was going to play on TV.
